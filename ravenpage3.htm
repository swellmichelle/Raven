    <h1>The Raven</h1>
    
    <p>By Edgar Allan Poe</p>
    
    <p>Chapter 2</p>
    
    <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
      In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>
        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-<br>
      Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-<br>
                    Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
    
    <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
      By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.<br>
       "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,<br>
       Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore-<br>
      Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br>
                    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
    
    <p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
      Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;<br>
        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
        Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-<br>
      Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
                    With such name as "Nevermore."</p>
    
    <p>But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>
      That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
        Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-<br>
        Till I scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown before-<br>
      On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br>
                    Then the bird said, "Nevermore."</p>
    
    <p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
      "Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store,<br>
         Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
         Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-<br>
      Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
                    Of 'Never- nevermore'."</p>
    
    <p>But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,<br>
      Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>
        Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
        Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-<br>
      What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br>
                    Meant in croaking "Nevermore."</p>
