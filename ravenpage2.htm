    <h1>The Raven</h1>
    
    <h2>By Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
    
    <p id="id1">Chapter One</p>
    
    <p class="first">Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
      Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br>
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
       As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
      "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-<br>
                    Only this, and nothing more."</p>
    
    <p class="second">Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br>
      And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
        Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
        From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-<br>
      For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-<br>
                    Nameless here for evermore.</p>
    
    <p class="third">And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
      Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br>
        "'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-<br>
      Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-<br>
                    This it is, and nothing more."</p>
    
    <p class="fourth">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
      "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
      That I scarce was sure I heard you"- here I opened wide the door;-<br>
                    Darkness there, and nothing more.</p>
    
    <p class="fifth">Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,fearing,<br>
      Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;<br>
        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
        And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br>
      This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"-<br>
                    Merely this, and nothing more.</p>
    
    <p class="sixth">Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
       Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>
        "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice:<br>
        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-<br>
      Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-<br>
                    'Tis the wind and nothing more."</p>
