    <h1>The Raven</h1>
    
    <p>By Edgar Allan Poe</p>
    
    <p>Chapter 3</p>
    
    <p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
      To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;<br>
        This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
        On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,<br>
      But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,<br>
                    She shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>
    
    <p>Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
      Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
        "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he hath sent thee<br>
        Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!<br>
      Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!"<br>
                    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
    
    <p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or devil!-<br>
      Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
        Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-<br>
        On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-<br>
      Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!"<br>
                    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
    
    <p>"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
      By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-<br>
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
        It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-<br>
      Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."<br>
                    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
    
    <p>"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting-<br>
      "Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!<br>
        Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
        Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!<br>
      Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"<br>
                   Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."</p>
    
    <p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
      On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
        And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,<br>
        And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
      And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
                    Shall be lifted- nevermore!</p>
